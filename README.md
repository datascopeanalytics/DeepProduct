To get started, make sure you're using Python 3 and then create an environment using something like

```virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

this will install Tensorflow and Keras (amongst other things), so it may take slightly longer than usual.

With the environment active, view the notebook by launching the jupyter server

```jupyter notebook```

The code will need to download several files of order ~100MB when being first run, but will cache them for future execution.
