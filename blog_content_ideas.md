# Potential Blog Post Outline
### (or, Ross Takes A Stab at Main Points We May Want to Hit Here)

## Motivation

* Out at lunch one day, Chris sees a light fixture that speaks to him. He likes it so much that he takes a photo of it

* "I wish there were an app that allowed me to find this thing that I saw."  This is an example of a user story that motivates the need for "visual search," a subset of the burgeoning field of computer vision.

* Turns out we aren't the only ones to have this idea. 
	* Back in March of this year, [Pinterest released a beta version of a visual search application called Lens](https://blog.pinterest.com/en/and-you-get-lens-and-you-get-lens-and-you-get-lens).
	* A few days after Chris found the light fixture of his dreams, Amazon announced a "product social discovery network" that's basically [Instagram with links directly from photos to Prime pages](https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/07/amazon-spark-is-a-product-discovery-social-network-that-looks-like-instagram/) 

* While this effectively crushed our desires of moving to the Bay Area and tracking down angel investors to make Chris's application a reality, it didn't stop us from seeing how much progress we could make in building a visual search engine using publicly available data and open source code

## How to Train Your Computer (a basic introduction to CNN)

* We could very easily just take a photo of the drawing on the board by the internet cabinet
